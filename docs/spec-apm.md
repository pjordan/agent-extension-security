# APM Schema

Current schema file:

- `spec/apm/v0/apm.schema.json`

Status:

- Placeholder only in v0 scaffold.
- Effective permissions currently live inside AEM.

Planned evolution:

- Split standalone APM from AEM
- Add policy-relevant permission dimensions (for example OAuth scopes/secrets)
- Add compatibility and migration guidance between schema versions
