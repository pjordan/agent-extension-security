# Agent Extension Security

`agentsec` is a reference CLI and policy engine for securing agent extensions:

- Skills
- MCP servers
- Plugins/connectors

## What you can do today

- Package extension artifacts
- Generate and validate AEM manifests
- Produce reference SBOM/provenance/scan attestations
- Sign and verify artifacts with local Ed25519 dev keys
- Enforce install-time policy checks

## Start here

- New user: [Quickstart](quickstart.md)
- Installing binaries from releases: [Install & Release Verification](install.md)
- Full command details: [CLI Reference](cli-reference.md)
- Security assumptions and controls: [Security Model](threat-model.md)
- Current maturity boundaries: [Production Readiness](production-readiness.md)

## Project status

This project is intentionally a scaffold: hardened where it matters for a reference implementation, but not yet a full production supply-chain platform.

See [Production Readiness](production-readiness.md) for an explicit capability matrix and next-step roadmap.
