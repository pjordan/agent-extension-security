# Hello World Skill

This is a minimal example skill. In real ecosystems, a "skill" might be a folder that contains:
- instructions (this file)
- scripts and resources
- a manifest describing permissions and provenance

## What it does

- Prints a friendly message
- Demonstrates packaging and scanning

## Usage

If your agent runtime supports skills, you would invoke this by its id:
`com.example.hello-world`

## Safety

This example does **not** ask you to run shell commands, download scripts, or install packages.
